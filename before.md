Dear workshop participants.

We are planning a mixture of topics to give you an idea of what are the challenges and opportunities in the responsible ML. Prepare for discussions about the life cycle of the predictive model, explainability, interpretability, automation and fairness.

During the workshop we will talk about theory, but we will also show you how to solve certain problems in an R console (live!).
You will also be able to reproduce the presented solutions and solve additional tasks.

If you want to fully participate in the hands-on part, you need the following packages (CRAN versions are ok)

```
library("DALEX")
library("ranger")
library("rpart")
library("ggplot2")

library("modelStudio")
library("arenar")

library("fairmodels")

library("tidyr")
library("mlr3")
library("gbm")
library("gam")
library("e1071")
library("earth") 
library("magrittr")
library("patchwork")

library("ingredients")
library("iBreakDown")
```
